This is the story of a kid, 
A kid who comes from a dark past, 
One who had been alienated from love, 
or maybe, he didn't understand it quite much. 

This kid, grew older into young, hot blood,
and naturally, he set out in the search for love. 
He desperately finds the one, 
who can give him all the love he deserves. 

He thinks she is the one, 
and that their destinies are intertwined, 
This is, infact true, 
but he needn't hunt for love forever. 

In the search for a waterfall, 
he ignores a small pond that lies just nearby. 
He doesn't realise, its pretty deep,
deep enough to quench his thirst. 

His friends are enough,
all the love in the world stands ready for him
But in his motivation, and in his greed, 
he leaves that pond unseen. 

He will indeed find her one day,
He will get, all the love he needs. 
But untill then, will it be too late,
so late that the pond dries up to the bottom ?

The pond may be small for him,
but its importance stands huge. 
He must act before its too late,
too late just like his family did for him. 

The family did give love, 
but by the time his skin was thick. 
He did acknowledge, the love he got,
but was too foolish, to forgive all the hate he recieved.

It was not really hate,
but the praise he never ever got. 
It seemed for him the past was always dark, 
that was because, there ever was no light.

No light bright enough, 
that could wash away the darkness.
Things were just too dense for him,
too dense to let them go.
