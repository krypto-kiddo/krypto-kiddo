Figuring out myself
one step at a time,
a little by  little,
every day that passes by. 

Thanks for pushing me,
into sadness again,
helping me realise,
where the fault lies. 

The issue with me,
is that I expect,
and depend on others,
to make me feel happy.

All the others do,
is only let me down,
fail my expectations,
dissapoint me over and over. 

You see, thats where it is,
thats the fault i see.
Why expect others to give me,
something that lies within.
 
Why keep searching,
for the spark outside,
why ignore the radiance,
that lies inside.

How can I expect,
others to make me happy,
happiness is something,
that lies within

I dont need anyone,
to come and save me,
help me decorate my life with memories,
only to eventually disappoint me. 

Its not the first time,
Im afraid its not the last,
I think I put my faith in the wrong person again,
I guess I need to stop. 

I put my ego away,
let my self value down a bit,
Its sad how people who own treasures,
dont seem to value it. 

Yet I stand here again,
A dillema in my way,
I dont wanna leave but,
I dont wanna stay. 

Then again why blame someone,
for one thats not worth it.
Why should I expect someone else,
to give me what lies within.

(Note to self: please dont quit, let some clarity set in)
