On the run 
I got a target to chase,
people think its all games and fun,
untill you start to breathe the haze.

Its not easy stepping out on a new way,
Not all glory, all fame as they say.
Its so dangerous, its just crazy,
definitely not a sport for the lazy

keep running all day,
driving off into the sunset,
keep movin and all I can do is pray,
asking destiny if we've ever met.

Left my old life behind,
now there's no going back,
hunting around for people my kind,
I've got dreams to stack

got guns in my hands,
and roses in my head,
Its all the way to the top stands,
or else imma dead. 

gotta get too far,
if not far enough,
gotta erase that scar,
and move on with stuff

Not a playground for dummies,
we're betting on our lives here,
go get back to your mommies,
If all you're filled with is fear. 

Its a tough path kid,
I aint got the time to explain,
not for people who try to fit,
not for the ones who wish to stay sane. 

I know you got the muscle,
I know you got a sharp brain,
but do you have the guts,
to bare with all the pain

If you do you're welcome,
come in and join the hustle,
its about to get troublesome,
cause its your life's final puzzle.

Stand by my side,
and you'll have my trust,
keep your eyes open wide,
a blink and its all dust.

Stand in front of me,
and you'll wonder what's worse,
to drown in a burning sea,
or to live with a curse.
