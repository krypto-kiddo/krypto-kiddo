oh there's so much to risk,
but its gone when I open my eyes,
there's so much I gotta fix,
only guesses, i can devise

to be or not to be,
i'm so confused cant you see,
you walk in when you want to,
then dissapear like you always do.

have you been testing me,
have I been trying you, 
oh it looks all games to me, 
what's false and what is true

I know you've lied to me,
I know that you know,
But I still accept you the way you are,
I want to, but I wont go.

I need the strength to hold on,
you dont know but you make it hard,
sometimes I'm afraid you'll be gone,
sometimes I think of walking apart. 

I dont wanna lose you again,
funny that I never had you in the first place,
scared it all might go in vain,
but then I see that look on your face. 

oh I've been overthinking lately,
have you ever wanted to be mine,
I cant really figure out honestly,
if you're just being too kind.

I just want to let you know,
clear out things between us,
I've been wanting you so bad lately,
but I dont know who I am to you. 

Maybe I am just your plan B,
I know i was never your number one,
Maybe you're just a friend to me,
I don't really know what to do. 

Do I stay out of it,
Do I go all the way in,
'cause you wont stay out of it,
neither will you go all in. 

You come up with plans,
make me a part of it,
then make it look like I want it,
and then make me beg for it. 

Oh you're just very forgetful,
and I'm filled with ego,
you need reminders all the time,
and I dont like to ask twice.

so I keep seeing holes everywhere,
I keep trying to fill them up,
I keep seeing dots everywhere,
I just try to connect them all.

Things add up both ways,
cant say if you're really into me,
Nothing's clear these days,
I like you so much, cant you really see. 

So I'm not sure about anything else,
but there's one thing for sure,
you were right when you said that night,
I dont even really know you.
