Since forever isn't forever,
lets vibe untill whenever, 
Cheers to all the moments we had, 
cheers to all we will. 

Really glad that it lasted,
Really glad it ended,
I know its done and dusted, 
But we got what we wanted. 

I know sometimes,
its hard to let go...
I know sometimes,
its painful to know...
But I know sometimes,
all sunshine makes a desert,
and I know sometimes, 
It feels so good to feel so light .. [DROP]
