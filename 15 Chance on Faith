Somewhere, Something beautiful,
is waiting to be found.

But the most interesting part is,
you dont have to find it,
you simply cant. 
It wont be found by seeking. 

And there's nothing,
that you can do about it. 
It supposed to happen on its own,
You stumble on it, when the time comes. 

You have to be patient, 
you have to wait calmly, 
if its meant to be,
it will be. 

You can only put in your faith,
and give it time to build,
and the longer it takes,
it will only bond stronger. 

Yet within, lies the fear,
of faces fading away,
no matter what you see and hear,
worthy ones will stay. 

I know you've been broken before,
heard promises that never lasted,
I know its hard to trust someone now, 
but believe me, this one's different. 

You are stupid if you havent realised,
That this one's not like the others,
yet you keep acting and expecting,
like this one will also be like them. 

Its not them but you,
who doesnt realise what its worth,
the gem that you've stumbled upon,
believe me its not going anywhere.

You are the one who needs to be patient,
you are the one who needs to believe,
you are the one who needs to stay,
cause you are the one they build empires with.

Its all about trust, faith and time.
Why do you worry son,
when destiny's got your back,
you've always got the best in store. 

And in the unfortunate event,
if they dont turn out to be the one,
believe me when i say it, 
maybe god didn't want you to settle for less.

You are getting tired cause you know,
You've been running all your life,
sometimes away from people,
sometimes your greed leaves them behind.

I am asking you to stay,
I am asking you to put your trust in this,
Just take a chance on faith,
I know you will be alright boy. 

Everything will turn out fine, 
Hang in there and dont forget,
somewhere, something beautiful,
is waiting to be found.
