My ult

once in a while i do hit my ult. 
I dont know as of now if it happens with everyone,
But when i do, 
give me any task, 
the progress is jaw dropping. 
And the speed is mindblowing. 
I feel like a god. 
Confident as hell,
i feel on the top of the world
I will often dance. 

At this moment,
a million things keep running through my mind, 
but in this period its not at all annoying or frustrating, 
the turbulence feels sweet. 
All the thoughts run smooth, they are all connected very well. 
I can focus all the energy towards one thing. 
For hours, as of now. 
Usually it goes up to 3-4 hours. 

These few hours,
I am very brave and confident. 
I embrace everything positively, 
I am the best at whatever I do, 
I feel myself to be the smartest guy in the room. 
Even when the person in front is actually better,
i always find a clever reply, 
it just gets very very difficult to not let me get what i want to. 
And yes sometimes i end up a little overconfident,
but for some reason it impresses everyone around. 

I am writing this when I am actually in my ult state, 
so i can understand it better later. 
Minutes are passing away like seconds, 
And i am getting late to do what i want to.
I just want to get so much done just now,
because i know now is the time. 

I think fresh favorite music triggers/enhances this.
Or also when i am challenged. 
A colleague challenged me in public about 9 hours ago. 
The challenge was on a completely unrelated thing though. 

I want to get closer to control this state. 
once i do, I know i will be invincible, 
just like i say to myself every morning,
in front of a mirror. 

Cheers!
