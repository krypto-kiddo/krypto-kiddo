Is it true ?
I see the patterns repeat again. 
There's new characters,
but the plot never changes. 

Am i headed towards another downfall ?
are things gonna meet the same horrible end ?
Am i overthinking things again ?
nothing's wrong about my thinkings so far, i believe. 

Is everyone the same ?
Maybe thats too quick to judge,
this might only be the second time, 
but it all looks the same from here. 

everything is different this time, 
except for me, the one who's the same from before. 
Does that mean i am the one at fault ?
but how does that even happen. 

Things are quite big to be centered at me,
or do i just end up walking into the same centers, 
and find myself in the line of fire again ? 
Not ready to take the same bullet twice. 


everything feels the same as before i swear,
glad there's no feelings involved this time,
better to probably keep it that way.
reckon its not too late yet,not for this center.  

The only thing i can do is,
sit back and trust in that one person, 
that they dont play the same move again,
it will be too hard to take if they did. 

The other thing i can do is,
to hold on as long as i can,
not run away from this center,
and blame it on to others. 

The center depends heavily,
on two characters here,
i will not runaway, play my part.
and hope they play their part clear.
