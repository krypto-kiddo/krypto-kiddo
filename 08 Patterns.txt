They say to let go of the past, 
but some patterns hide in there. 
Isn't it fun when you look back at things,
from a different perspective. 

One thing you'll find is that, 
everything happens in cycles,
everything follows a pattern,
some of us are better at spotting them. 

If you know the sequence,
you can generate it further,
if you know the past well,
you will understand the future. 

But beware you might get caught up in the past,
for its a hole not meant for beginners,
sometimes, you might not be able to let go,
and sometimes, the nostalgia becomes addictive.

Everyone is running calculations up there,
but everyone's got a different mind,
oh yes everyone's got the same build.
but it has been cultivated uniquely. 

but this "unique" is not so unique, 
everyone calculates differently,
this leads to different outcomes,
but they all think in a pattern.

The mind is a powerful weapon,
the bigger it gets, the harder to control it. 
But be careful while handling it,
I've seen a close one lose control.
