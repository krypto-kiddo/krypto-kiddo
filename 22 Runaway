I've spent too much time in the past.
Been on a drug called nostalgia.
I've been running away from reality.
Running away from things I should've held on to.
Running away from things I shouldn't have.
Broken things without meaning to,
Put an end to beautiful stories that had just begun.

And then today, hits the reckoning, 
Running away was never wrong,
Its just the wrong things i've been running away from. 
Its time I step out of the past, 
accept that my past does not define me,
but not forget what built me up.

Its time to runaway,
Its time to breakfree,
not from people or responsibilites,
but the heavy memories I hold on to. 

I've already been putting closure,
to deep holes left open,
let go of the weight,
of heavy memories from years ago.

Mistakes were made in history,
I've learnt what I wanted from them,
theres no point anymore,
in keeping old books open. 

If i keep revisiting them all in my head,
I'll inevitably lead myself to repeat them.
My mind will manifest them into reality
oh I swear.

I can be anything I believe,
I've trained my mind over years to control my reality,
The hard part that I face right now,
is controlling what I believe.

I often find myself surrounded in unwanted thoughts,
been running my mind in a way its not supposed to,
Although it cant really harm me in any way,
Cause I'm so fucking invincible, even I cant bring myself down. 

I bare the deadliest weapon known to mankind,
I am the weapon,
I've been learning to use it, 
The day I master it, I'll go down in history for centuries. 
And i dont know but I believe,
I'm not gonna be alone when I do.
