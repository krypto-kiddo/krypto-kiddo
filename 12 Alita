Its time to accept,
its time to let go. 
You've been through this,
in cycles over and over

You've seen this stage,
and decided to runaway,
every time, its the same, 
every time, it brings downfall. 

This time, things have been different,
so shall this be too,
 this time lets face it, 
lets try something different

Its finally time, 
time you grew up.
Raise your head up,
and go through it. 

You've never seen whats beyond, 
for you never dared to go through,
for this one time lets dive in,
see if there's peace beyond.

if you ever forget, 
come back and read this again,
this shall give you strength,
and remind you of the purpose.
