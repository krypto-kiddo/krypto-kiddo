humans do not have the right to look into the future,
they never have, all along. They are being punished, for a crime they never comitted. 
Its understandable, that they are being kept away from something too powerful for them to handle. Although if you keep them away forever, how will they ever learn ? 
How do you make someone believe fire hurts untill you dont let them burn themselves once. sometimes it takes more than once, but eventually, they learn. They all do. 

I may be begging for something we dont deserve at the moment, I'm waging a war against the gods, I am going against my own kind... for they... have gone against everything I've ever believed in. 

And its too late to stop anything now my friend, It has already begun, I cant be stopped until I'm dead, and gods never die. 
I am unstoppable dear, and that's what they know me for. And they know I am coming for them tonight.
