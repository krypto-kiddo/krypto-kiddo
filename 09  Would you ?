Lets say you had a power,
You were a little different,
You've felt it all your life,
but you were afraid if they would understand what you tell them. 

You know that this is not normal,
Not everyone has it, 
but you just decide to ignore it,
so you feel more normal and fit into the crowd.

You feel scared society won't accept you, 
Because you are not one of them,
Beacause you have it and they dont,
But you hide it out of shame. 

You know deep down you have it, 
Sometimes you are excited about it,
You get rare chances when you can show a glimpse of it,
but when you do, everyone's impressed. 

But then you feel all alone,
even in the middle of a million people.
You feel surrounded by solitude,
Cause its hard to find someone like you.

At one point this will take its toll, 
And then you'll set out searching desperately,
for someone thats like you,
only to find somehwere you belong. 

You will find people who seem to have it,
You will open up to them about it,
For you've been desperate,
To share the feeling with someone. 

But then unfortunately,
The person you found was not the same as you, 
They may be jealous, hateful, scared or confused,
'cause they're not used to seeing something so unusual, so rare. 

And then you will close your walls again, 
think twice about opening up again. 
You will find yourself alone again,
untill you find the spark in someone ... again. 

You may belong among descendants of gods,
You were just born with it, and people will hate it. 
Your wings will spread wider than their narrow minds,
You know you dont belong to this world. 

Lets say you had a power,
would you dare to tell someone ?
