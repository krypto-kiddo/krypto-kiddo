This is my story
I write it the way i want to
and I write it,
in a way no one's ever seen before. 

Its about making it beautiful,
making it big. 
Its about how perfectly,
the ends meet one another

Its a cycle, a long process,
one that starts the other,
and the other that finishes the one. 

Its filled with patterns,
yet so unpredictible. 
Its so complicated,
yet so simple. 

This one is beyond perception,
something that cant be seen,
can barely be felt,
but more evident than truth itself.

This is not normal, friend, 
this was never meant to be normal.
People only question things,
that they are dumb enough to not understand. 

The cleverest ones dont get it,
Cause they were defined clever,
by ones who're dumber themselves,
this is unfortunate in itself. 

Whats the point in building monuments,
to pull of herculean efforts with ease,
when there's only a few to witness it,
and none of them will understand what you did. 

Its easy to praise,
easier to not, 
a little harder to be inspired,
but impossible to pull it off themselves. 

Its not easy being different,
To speak my own language,
live in a beautiful world,
that I built for myself.

For there's no one to share it with,
I had to shoot up high, cause I had wings.
I find myself alone above the clouds,
I never asked god for me to be this way.

I dont wanna set foot on the ground either,
Its too beautiful up here,
I wanna bring people to this place,
show them what they're missing out on.

I keep trying to get them to fly,
Its not their fault they got no wings,
Why dont they all have wings,
why is it has to be so lonely up here.

But I know one thing my  friend,
You for one, have wings of your  own,
whats stopping you from spreading them
whats stopping you from leaving your ground

Untill then, untill time permits,
I will stay up here, waiting for you,
eager to show you the beauty this world hides, 
how its so addicting than the world down there.

I have waited cycles,
I have waited centuries,
I may or may not discover you in this one,
but I will again come back next cycle, as I always do.
