You have given me,
everything I've asked for. 
And you've always served
me the best in store. 

I asked you for money,
you keep popping some greens
from random places,
whenever I fall short. 

I asked you for girls,
you sent more than I needed,
yet I used to act like 
I couldnt ever get enough

And then I asked you
to send someone,
to build my dreams with,
someone to share the tale with. 

Oh but you knew,
One person could never
have existed who
could teach me everything. 

So you started sending people,
one after the other,
they had to go cause their work was done,
sometimes I think what if they stayed. 

This goes on in cycles,
everytime you send someone,
its way better than
the one that came before. 

It wouldnt be right
to compare people,
but it is pretty evident,
that they get better everytime. 

Although I wait eagerly,
for the cycles to stop one day,
the day when I realise,
this one isn't going away

Its kind of like a kid,
who wants to grow up fast,
settle down as an adult,
turn into their best. 

The adult only knows,
things were easy as a kid,
every phase has its own
ups and downs and pros and cons. 

My thing is 
just like that.
I want the cycles to stop eagerly,
find the one thats destined to stay.

I am not desperate,
I am just curios to find out,
how was it possible for you,
to send someone that could match my league. 

I find it impossible,
yet I believe someone exists,
and that one day I'll find them,
It will only be a miracle to realise someone does. 

But untill then,
the cycle will keep repeating,
old ones will wither away,
new ones will keep setting in. 

I know this cycle would stop one day,
and for this day, I wait eagerly.
