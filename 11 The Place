(originally titled "The Battle of the Chosen 7/7)
(hints to something, some place, i wrote it myself long ago and forgot completely, Here's the whole manuscript unedited)

This is where ground meets the sky (1)
This is where truth meets the eye 
This is where the act is done,
This is where all shades come to one. 

This is where the wars start (4)
This is where violence is art
This is where ideas go dark
This is where sorrow leaves her mark.

This is where the sun comes down (3)
This is where promises drown
This is where legacies collide
This is where philosophers divide

This is where the kingdom falls
This is where destiny calls
This is where heroes cry
This is where the treasures lie

This is where apologies burn (2)
This is where idealists turn
This is where artists cry
This is where prophecies die

This is where mercy is denied (5)
This is where the critics lied
This is where love meets pain
This is where efforts go in vain

This is where the legends meet
This is where promises go discreet
This is where rebellion met mason,
This is the battle of the chosen
