Well its a weird feeling tbh, 
I have been missing something that i never had, never knew. 
Been trying to find something that i doesnt even know if it exists. 
still stuck in that certain point of childhood, from where i guess i never moved on. 
Its a very weird feeling that makes a void inside. 

But then, this void is too small for the belief inside. 
The belief that a place exists where i belong, 
a place where i've always deserved to be. 
A place where fairytales come true. 

So what if i didnt get the chance to be born into a fairytale,
so what if the circumstances dont look like heaven, 
so what if i didnt get what everyone dreams of. 
I know and I will, get what i deserve.
Sooner or later, it will all fall into place, 
The puzzle will be complete,
and it will be a picture so big, so beautiful, 
Something that will be the greatest thing the mankind has seen in a while. 
Something, that people will remember for thousands of years if not hundereds, 
something, that is exactly what i am born to be.
