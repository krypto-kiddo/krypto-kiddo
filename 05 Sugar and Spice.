Do you know how it feels, when you always think you are one step closer,
but then things push you back down, You do stand up again... but only to be pushed back down over and over. 

It can be so interesting how you can fall so hard for someone you didn't expect at all to be.
And yet how beautifully you can be pushed back down, deep into oblivion. 
You feel like closing yourself in a room and question everything in front of you.
You close your eyes and requestion the past, But foeget to open your eyes and notice the sun has already risen. 
You think its still night with your eyes closed, its not easy, but you gotta move on. 
Yes you would want to sit back in that same old corner and cry it all out, 
but turn that tears into rage, get that motivation from that hate. 
She meant it when she said you deserve better, Keep hustling. 

And then I think, isn't this exactly what makes life interesting.
All sunshine makes a desert. Believe me, its so much fun to cherish the dark moments in life. 
These are the nights i live for, 
what fun is a straight empty road to drive on,
what fun is a trek with no summit to reach for, 
what fun is a dive when there's no height to climb to, 
what fun would it be if it wasn't worth it ?

I swear its so epic and fun with all of it added in. 
A little sugar, a little spice.
