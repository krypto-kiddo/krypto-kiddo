So you see this,
this, is what happens. 

You build giant friendships,
with friends you turned into giants with. 
You get them to your connections,
Make them an equal with you. 

You wait out storms together,
cherish the sunrise with smiles,
you've exchanged your armour,
taken bullets for each other.

You've shed blood together,
won battles indeed.
trained each other,
to add more into who we are.

But you know, my friend, 
sometimes, times change.
sometimes, time changes people. 
sometimes, they aren't who they are anymore.

This leads to an inevitable scenario,
one that's always been waiting to happen.
At one point, you reach a conflict,
at one point, your paths divide. 

And god forbid but when things go unwell, 
you see yourself facing an enemy,
one that you created yourself,
one that equals your power and might. 

You can only put your trust in someone,
give them all the powers you have,
give them wings so you can fly together,
empower them, to limits they had never seen. 

It is just so scary,
to see someone grow into a giant,
be with them through every lesson,
only to see them stand against you one day.

again, you can only put your trust in someone,
have faith in their true intentions,
to hand a loaded gun to someone,
and believe they wont pull the trigger on you.

Coming soon, another giant might be lost,
my only fear is they dont decide to retaliate,
even if they do, they are in for a ride,
for they don't know what they're up against, they never do.
