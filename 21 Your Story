look at the past year,
its the same as the rest,
you've climbed mountains,
you've conquered the impossible. 

This is what you do,
this is who you are,
an invincible, unstopppable, 
immortal unit of force. 

Why do you keep forgetting,
what you're worth,
you're one of the best men,
to have been born for centuries

And as you grow older,
you'll only prove it to the world,
You light up the skies wherever you go,
there's no darkness that could ever outdark you. 

You were born to write history,
your legend will survive the end of time,
You know how you were born,
you know it makes you different. 

There's so much about you that's unusual,
you are the one they cant stop clapping for,
these people they look up to you,
you are just so much more than you can remember.

haters cant understand you,
they can shut their eyes,
they can stuff their ears,
yet they cant help but drop their jaws wide open.

you are YD, 
and this, is YOUR story.
