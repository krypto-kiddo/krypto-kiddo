I always kept thinking, 
there is a boy that lives inside.
The kid that is within, 
the kid that must never die. 

I had an inner child, 
I must always keep alive, 
for it did give me the strength,
the valour, and the pride. 

This always made me feel, 
It was weak and maybe dying,
with age and with the changes,
I thought it was slipping away.

I kept chasing nostalgia, 
in hopes to bring my groove back.
But then I suddenly reckon, 
did I ever even lose my grove.

So what if a sapling grew a rough bark,
I am only taller and stronger now, 
Things may not look,
the way they were before. 

But hardly does it mean,
anything's changed on the inside. 
My core remains pure,
and my mind hardened. 

I am only sharper and better, 
stronger and more fierce,
than what I'd been before,
and this shall only rise. 

There is still no difference,
The past and the present remains same,
The same soul, the same mind,
It has been me, and always will be. 

And my groove ?
Who even took it away, 
when did it even fall, 
was there even a hollow inside. 

It was all in my head,
the groove was never gone, 
I am, always what I have been,
And i shall continue to be

To be bright and bold, 
be in the stories foretold. 
Be the one in legends of gold,
Young and brave and sweet but cold. 

As for the kid, he remains alive,
forever and ever as I do,
Because the kid is me,
and I am, the kid.
