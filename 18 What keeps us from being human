We all have our certain coping mechanisms to things in life. 
Sometimes they're productive... Some... not so healthy. 
Oh you ask about me ? , 
I'm a workaholic, 
i work when i can't handle my reality... 
Why do you think you see me working all the time ? 
You see people like us on the top, you always see the shine, the glitter, the gold.. 
but the efforts and the darkness that makes it shine? 
They rarely see it. 
Yes we are the best,
but you should know,
not all of us necessarily chose to be this way.

We do things differently because we grew up different, 
our minds are used to seeing things in a very different way. 
Some of us succumb to it , but you won't hear about them,
the others, like me, we bear this curse as a gift. 
It's a superpower, 
it's what helps us push beyond human limits. 

The thing that keeps us from being human is the very thing that keeps us ahead of them.
