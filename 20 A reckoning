you know,
its about money,
its about power,
its about fame.

Its about conquering the world,
winning hearts, popping smiles, 
making the planet,
a better place to live.

It always has been.

But you should know,
the purpose behind it.
Its about the freedom that comes with it,
its about finding a place I can call home. 

It might look like nothing,
from far away, where you stand.
But its a huge revolution down here in my mind,
its a war for independence. 

One way or the other,
I am gonna make it,
and there's no one that can stop me,
I stand unstoppable.

Because I know I am backed by whom,
always have been, always will be.
I will meet her on the top,
finally when I make it one day.

But the question is, my friend,
are you  really willing to tag along. 
Cause you're like a risky bet,
that I have a lot of hopes on.

I am ready to put in my time,
I am ready to put in my efforts,
I expect you to do the same, 
I want you to be there with me on the top.

I often doubt if you feel the same,
or what your intentions truly are,
I have been lied to once,
nothing's stopping you from doing that again. 

I really must be a fool, 
to put my faith so hard into you,
but I hope everything's gonna turn out great,
I dont take risks usually but I'll take one on this. 

'Cause you're rare,
you understand what I do,
and why I need to do it, 
or you make it look like it for the least. 

But isn't that what life's about, 
You put in your trust,
if you fail, you improvise,
if not, you've won!

Maybe you'll turn out to be a great partner,
or you'll turnout to be another distraction,
Let's see if I am correct,
or if Naidude wins this one. 

I am not gonna runaway,
not like I do everytime, 
This time, Its gonna be different,
this time, I will try not to give up. 

But you gotta give me hope, 
If you really wanna do it, 
you gotta show it that you want it,
you need to work hard for it. 

Good things in life don't come easy,
They take time and efforts,
I gotta be more patient and optimistic, 
and you gotta man the fuck up

Rise up and pull yourself together
it's not good to see you this way,
< idk i got interrupted here, lost my train of thoughts, so thats all folks >
